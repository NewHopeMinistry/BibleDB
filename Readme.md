<H3 style="text-align: center">BibleDB Project</h3>

The BibleDB Project contains verse data for 16 different versions of the Bible. The BibleDB.db SQLite3 database is the master database for the entire project. The data for each version is stored in the VerseData folder, within their own folder. All of the files are stored in this database, and all the other files types were rendered from this database.
