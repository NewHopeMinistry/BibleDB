<H3 style="text-align: center">Bible Database Project</h3>

The Bible Database Project contains verse data for 16 different versions of the Bible. The BibleDB.db SQLite3 relational database is the master database for the entire project, all the verses for each Bible version are stored in this database, as well as other data such as versions and books. All the other data file types for each version are stored in the VerseData folder, under their own folder, and they were rendered from the BibleDB.db database. Because of its size the BibleDB.db database is stored here as a .zip compressed file named BibleDB.zip. BibleDB.zip must be decompressed before it can be used.
