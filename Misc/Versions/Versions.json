        "History": "The Twenty-First Century Version (TWF) paraphrased Bible  translation was begun shortly after I had an extended stay in the hospital in 2018. I feel very strongly that God has called me to do this work, and I have dedicated myself to it since then. The Holy Spirit is my guiding influence in this endeavor. The Spirit has revealed to me that God wants a new scripture with a much softer and more forgiving tone than the traditional Scriptures. This is not a word for word translation of the Bible, but it is a faithful translation of the Bible. Each verse is analyzed for what it is truly trying to say, and is rewritten in such a way that I can understand what it's saying. It's a translation for me, using modern 21st century English, grammar, and punctuation. The foundation for this translation is the King James Version (KJV), which I find very confusing and difficult to understand. There is a lot of redundancy and repetion within the verses in the old texts. I have tried to proplerly structure the sentences so that run-on sentences, sentences that say the same thing over and over again. I am also trying to restructure the sentences with the proper positioning of Nouns, Pronouns, Verbs, Adverbs, Adjecitives, Modifiers, and Descriptors.",
