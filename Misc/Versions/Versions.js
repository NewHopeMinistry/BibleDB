Released in 1999, the AKJ aimed to bridge the gap between the beautiful, but sometimes archaic, English of the KJV and the speech patterns of modern Americans. Engelbrite believed in staying faithful to the original meaning, so he focused on updating spellings and vocabulary rather than changing sentence structure or grammar. This kept the familiar and beloved style of the KJV while making it more accessible for contemporary readers. Engelbrite released the AKJ into the public domain, allowing anyone to freely copy, distribute, or even modify it, as long as the core message remained unchanged.",

        "History": "The American Standard Version (ASV) of the Bible, began in 1872 as a project to revise the 1611 King James Version. Phillip Schaff, assembled a team of 30 American and British scholars representing various Protestant denominations, and their efforts culminated in the publication of the revised New Testament in 1881 and the Old Testament in 1885, which was published in Great Britain as the Revised Version. However, the American scholars had suggested changes that were not included in the final British version. Consequently, they released their own version, the ASV, the New Testament was published in 1900 and the complete Bible in 1901. The ASV made use of the Westcott and Hort Greek New Testament and the Masoretic Text for the Old Testament, and it was the first major English translation to use \"Jehovah\" instead of God or Lord, as the Hebrew translation of YHWH. The ASV was popular at first, but it's archaic language limited its widespread adoption. It later served as the foundation for several 20th-century Bible translations, including the Revised Standard Version, the Amplified Bible, and the New American Standard Bible. Its commitment to a word-for-word translation philosophy has shaped modern Bible translations, balancing the need for literal accuracy with readability. Today, the ASV is in the public domain and it's freely available, and it continues to influence religious study and translation efforts.",

Webster believed that the Bible should be accessible to the common person without the need for commentaries to understand its language. His version maintained the familiar style of the KJV but aimed to make it more comprehensible for the average reader of his time. Despite his efforts, the NWB never achieved the popularity of the KJV, largely due to the deep-seated affection and familiarity the public held for the original version.

Richard Francis Weymouth (1822-1902) was a philologist (language expert) and biblical scholar, who was Weymouth was a Baptist layman and the headmaster of a London school. Weymouth wanted to create a New Testament translation in clear, understandable English for the general public. He wanted it to reflect how the inspired writers might have expressed themselves in 19th-century English. Weymouth translated the Greek text into English, aiming for a clear and natural style. The translation, along with editorial work by Ernest Hampden-Cook, was published in 1903. The WNT prioritizes using everyday English that is readily understandable to modern readers. The WNT has undergone several revisions since its initial publication. Some notable editions include the 1924 revision by scholars and the 1929 revision by James Alexander Robertson.",

        "History": "The World English Bible (WEB) is a modern English translation of the Bible that began in 1994 and was completed in 2020. It was initiated by Michael Paul Johnson, who felt a divine call to create a freely distributable English Bible. Without formal training, Johnson studied Greek and Hebrew and utilized scholarly works to start translating the New Testament. He shared his drafts online, incorporating feedback from volunteers. Realizing the enormity of the task, he decided to base his work on the American Standard Version (ASV) of 1901, which was in the public domain and known for its accuracy. Johnson's goal was to modernize the language of the ASV, which he began by creating custom computer programs to assist in the process. The initial draft, named the World English Bible, aimed to be accessible to all English speakers and was distributed via the internet. The WEB includes both American and British English versions and offers two Old Testament types: one with the protocanon and another with apocrypha.",

        "History": "The Young's Literal Translation (YLT) of the Bible is a unique work that stands out for its commitment to textual fidelity. Published in 1862 by Robert Young, the YLT was born out of a desire to render the scriptures as closely to the original texts as possible. Young, a self-taught scholar proficient in ancient languages, utilized the Textus Receptus and the Masoretic Text as the foundation for his translation. His approach was to maintain the tenses and idioms of the original languages, which often resulted in a translation that, while accurate, could be challenging to read due to its strict adherence to the source texts. The YLT underwent revisions, with a notable one in 1887, and a posthumous revision in 1898, ten years after Young's death. These revisions aimed to refine the translation without deviating from Young's original principles of literal translation. In 2020, a major revision called the Literal Standard Version was released, updating the YLT for contemporary readers while maintaining its literal approach. The YLT's legacy is its contribution to a more nuanced understanding of biblical texts, offering insights typically reserved for those familiar with the original languages.",
