However, the American scholars had suggested changes that were not included in the final British version. Consequently, they released their own version, the ASV, the New Testament was published in 1900 and the complete Bible in 1901. The ASV made use of the Westcott and Hort Greek New Testament and the Masoretic Text for the Old Testament, and it was the first major English translation to use "Jehovah" instead of God or Lord, as the Hebrew translation of YHWH. The ASV was popular at first, but it''s archaic language limited its widespread adoption. It later served as the foundation for several 20th-century Bible translations, including the Revised Standard Version, the Amplified Bible, and the New American Standard Bible.
