<h3 style="text-align: center;">New American Bible (NAB)</h3>
<br>
The New American Bible (NAB) paraphrased Bible translation was begun shortly after I had an extended stay in the hospital in 2018. I feel very strongly that God has called me to do this work, and I have dedicated myself to it since then. The Holy Spirit is my guiding influence in this endeavor. The Spirit has revealed to me that God wants a new scripture with a much softer and more forgiving tone than the traditional Scriptures. This is not a word for word translation of the Bible, but it is a faithful translation of the Bible. Each verse is analyzed for what it is truly trying to say, and is rewritten in such a way that I can understand it. It's a translation for me, and you if you want to read it. I use modern 21st century English, grammar, spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure. The foundation for this translation is the King James Version (KJV), which I find very confusing and difficult to read and understand. There is a lot of redundancy and repetion within the verses of the old texts, and I have tried to proplerly structure the sentences so that run-on sentences, sentences that say the same thing over and over again are properly structured for modern readers. I am restructuring the sentences by positioning the nouns, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, adjecitives, modifiers, and descriptors in the proper order. The status field in the following tables indicate the editing status of each chapter. The status indicates the chapter and verse edited, and Rough Draft means that initial editing on that chapter is finished.
