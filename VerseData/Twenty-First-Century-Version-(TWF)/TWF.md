<h3 style="text-align: center;">Twenty-First Century Version (TWF)</h3>
<br>
Work on the Twenty-First Century Version (TWF) was begun in 2018, shortly after an extended stay in the hospital, and I feel very strongly that God has called me to this work. The Holy Spirit is my guiding light in this endeavor, and has revealed to me that God wants a new scripture with a much softer and more forgiving tone than the traditional Scriptures. This is not a word for word Bible translation, it's my interpretation of the Bible, and a faithful interpretation of what the Holy Spirit is saying. Each verse is analyzed for what it's truly trying to say, and is rewritten in such a way that I can understand it. It's a translation for me, and for you, if you want it. I use modern 21st. century English, grammar, spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure. The foundation for this translation is the King James Version (KJV), which I find very confusing and difficult to read and understand. There is a lot of redundancy and repetion within the verses of the old texts, and I have tried to proplerly structure the sentences so that run-on sentences, sentences that say the same thing over and over again are properly structured for modern readers. I am restructuring the sentences by positioning the nouns, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, adjecitives, modifiers, and descriptors in the proper order for college level English grammar in the 21st. century. This version is being actively rewritten and is subject to change daily.
